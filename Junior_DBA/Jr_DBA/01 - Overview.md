From the perspective of the person who has used computers for school and work most of their life, the business side of computing can get complicated quickly. Most business require computers to handle various aspects of work which are usually much more demanding than a personal computer can handle. because of this increased requirement for performance various companies created more powerful versions of their operating systems called servers. 

The power comes from the ability to add more and higher powered CPU's, Memory, Storage. As review, if you imagine the computer as a work desk the CPU would be the brain, having multiple CPUs is like having multiple people working at the same desk. Windows 10 enterprise can handle a maximum of 2 CPU sockets, where Windows Server 2019 can handle up to 64. Memory, also known as Random Access Memory (RAM) or the buffer, can be considered equal to the size of the desk, if you have many people (CPUs) working on a small desk you will have one problem, and if you have one person working on a huge desk you have another. Windows 10 enterprise edition can handle 6 Terabytes of RAM, Windows Server 2019 can handle 24TB of RAM. 

It can be considered like the analogy of a restaurant. You make a request and your server take syour order back to the kitchen, waits on the food, and then delivers it back to you once it is ready. Similarly, the first web servers were used to deliver content to each visitor to a web site, different visitors requested different pages of information, and the server handled thos requests.
