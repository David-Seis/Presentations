The solution includes the following technologies - although you are not limited to these, they form the basis of the workshop. At the end of the workshop you will learn how to extrapolate these components into other solutions. You will cover these at an overview level, with references to much deeper training provided.

You'll need a local system that you are able to install software on. The workshop demonstrations use Microsoft Windows as an operating system and all examples use Windows for the workshop. Optionally, you can use a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to install the software on and work with the solution.

You must have a Microsoft Azure account with the ability to create assets.

This workshop expects that you understand <TODO: Enter a brief solution for what a student should know before taking the workshop>.

If you are new to these, here are a few references you can complete prior to class:

<a href="url" target="_blank">A full pre-requisites document is located here</a>. These instructions should be completed before the workshop starts, since you will not have time to cover these in class. <i>Remember to turn off any Virtual Machines from the Azure Portal when not taking the class so that you do incur charges (shutting down the machine in the VM itself is not sufficient)</i>.
