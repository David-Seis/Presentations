                "- **Type**: The object type tells what kind of object it is. For example, an object that represents a file is a FileInfo object¹.\n",

                "- **Methods**: The object methods are actions that you can perform on the object. For example, FileInfo objects have a CopyTo method that you can use to copy the file¹.\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Properties**: Object properties store information about the object. For example, FileInfo objects have a LastWriteTime property that stores the date and time that the file was most recently accessed¹.\n",

                "When commands are combined in a pipeline, they pass information to each other as objects¹. This object-oriented nature of PowerShell makes it powerful and flexible, allowing for efficient data manipulation and management².\n",
