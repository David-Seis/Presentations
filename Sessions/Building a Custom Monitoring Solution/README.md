Increasing the observability of your SQL Server Estate is key to making informed decisions. There are many paid options to manage and monitor SQL Server, but every tool is missing something. You can build a custom tool, for free to monitor the metrics you care about, and I will show you how to do that in this session. This session is designed for database administrators and developers who want to take control of their SQL Server monitoring and gain deeper insights into their systems.
