# Build a Custom Monitoring Solution for your SQL Server Environment

---

## Why Custom Monitoring? (Problem & Objective)

*   The Challenge with Off-the-Shelf Tools: **"Every tool is missing something."** They may not fully satisfy tailored needs.
*   The Goal: To **increase the observability of your SQL Server Estate**.
*   The Benefit: Enabling **informed decisions** regarding your database environment.
*   Solution: **Build a custom tool, for free**, allowing you to **monitor the specific metrics you care about**.
*   What this session will empower you to do: **Take control of your SQL Server monitoring** and gain **deeper insights into your systems**.
*   Target Audience: **Database Administrators (DBAs) and Developers**.

## Session Overview: The 3 Pillars

Our Approach: Building a custom solution with three key components:
*   **Part 1: Powershell to Collect Your Data**
*   **Part 2: SQL Server to Host Your Data**
*   **Part 3: PowerBI to Visualize Your Data**

Each part will be approximately 15-20 minutes.

## Part 1: Powershell to Collect Your Data

*   Purpose: **Automated collection of data** from SQL Server instances.
*   Why Powershell?: It's a **versatile tool** for interacting with SQL Server and operating systems.
*   What data can we collect?: A **wide array of performance metrics, configuration details, and health checks**.

Key Concepts & Examples:
*   Connecting to SQL Server.
*   Collecting Performance Counters (e.g., CPU, Memory, Disk I/O).
*   Gathering Configuration Details (e.g., database settings, instance properties).
*   Executing Custom T-SQL Queries for specific health checks.
*   Outputting Data: How to format and prepare data for SQL Server.

## Part 2: SQL Server to Host Your Data

*   Purpose: Serving as the **central repository for all the collected monitoring data**.
*   Why SQL Server itself?: Facilitates **structured storage of historical information**.
*   Benefits: Enables **easy querying, reporting, and long-term trend analysis**.

Key Concepts & Schema Design:
*   Database Design Principles: Considerations for performance and scalability of monitoring data.
*   Table Structures: Examples of tables for different metric types (e.g., instance metrics, database metrics, job status).
*   Data Types: Choosing appropriate data types for efficient storage.
*   Indexes: Crucial for query performance when analyzing historical data.
*   Data Retention: Strategies for managing data growth (e.g., archiving, purging).

Ingestion & Maintenance:
*   Ingestion Methods: How Powershell will insert data into SQL Server (e.g., Invoke-Sqlcmd, Bulk Insert).
*   SQL Server Agent Jobs: Scheduling Powershell scripts for automated data collection.
*   Maintenance Tasks: Backup, index maintenance, and cleanup.

## Part 3: PowerBI to Visualize Your Data

*   Purpose: **Creating interactive and insightful visualizations** of the collected data.
*   Why PowerBI?: Enables **easy interpretation of complex data**.
*   Benefits: Helps **identify performance bottlenecks**, **monitor trends**, and gain a **clear, at-a-glance understanding** of your SQL Server estate's status.

Connecting & Transforming Data:
*   Connecting to SQL Server: Using PowerBI Desktop to connect to your monitoring database.
*   Querying Data: Building T-SQL queries for specific reports (e.g., CPU usage over time, disk space trends).
*   Data Transformation (Power Query): Cleaning, shaping, and combining data for optimal visualization.

Creating Visualizations:
*   Choosing the Right Visual: Bar charts, line charts, tables, gauges for different metrics.
*   Designing Effective Dashboards: Layout, interactivity, filtering.
*   Examples: CPU utilization dashboard, Disk Space trending report, SQL Agent Job status monitor.

Publishing & Sharing:
*   PowerBI Service: Publishing reports to the cloud.
*   Sharing with Teams: Granting access and setting up refresh schedules.
*   Alerts: Setting up data-driven alerts for critical thresholds.
